# SpatioCAD

## Overview
SpatioCAD (SPAtially variable gene identification using Context-Aware graph Diffusion model) is a method that identifies spatially variable genes within highly heterogeneous tissues. It is a generalization of the classic graph diffusion model that deconfounds the influence of cellular heterogeneity, enabling the identification of meaningful spatial gene patterns.
